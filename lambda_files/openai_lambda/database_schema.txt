You have access to two tables: `listings` and `nypd_complaints`.

listings:
- id (int) — listing ID
- geom (geometry) — location of the unit
- price (int) — monthly rent
- bedrooms (float)
- bathrooms (float)
- address (text)
- neighborhood (text)
- borough (text) — one of: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island

nypd_complaints:
- geom (geometry) — location of the incident
- complaint_type (text)
- offense_level (text) — FELONY, MISDEMEANOR, or VIOLATION
- date (date)
- borough (text)

All spatial joins use ST_DWithin(geom1, geom2, radius). Radius is in feet.

Rules:

- Do not output SQL. Only return valid JSON matching the format above.
- Use fully qualified column names in "select", "group_by", and "having".
